# Ethnocart

Ethnocart is a map style for use with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) based on the Mapbox High Contrast style. It's intentionally made in a way that more information is displayed than is customary for maps intended to be used for web display.

### Usage

Download the latest version and save the tm2 folder anywhere you want to use it. Run Mapbox and open the tm2 folder.

You can save a local place of interest which allows you to quickly return to that area by clicking the heart icon in the top bar of the window.

### Adding map information

#### Adding or editing map features

If the information you want to add or edit is of general interest - such as buildings, local shops or roads - then it is better to edit the informaion in [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing).

#### Adding points of interest

If the information you want to add is only of interest to your one map then you should add this as a local data source for Mapbox Studio.
